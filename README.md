# Crypto Checker

[![Build Status](https://github.com/vehiloco/crypto-checker/workflows/CI/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/vehiloco/crypto-checker/workflows/CI/badge.svg?branch=master)

The Crypto Checker is a pluggable type system built on the Checker Framework. It
can help you find whether there are any weak or unsupported crypto algorithms
and the unsupported algorithm providers being used in your program. If the
Crypto Checker issues no warnings for a given program, then you have a guarantee
that your program at runtime will never have these issues.

The Crypto Checker aims to be sound, which means that a false positive may be
reported if your code is too complicated for it to understand. In this case, the
Crypto Checker also helps you improve your code style.

## Development notes

When updating the Checker Framework version, make sure to use the same version
across all `build.gradle` files.
